Larry Bird’s stats did not present him as a defensive forerunner because he wasn’t excelling in steals and blocks. Despite his defensive stats, Bird is considered to be one of the best defenders to play basketball. This outlook is due to Bird’s impressive stats (better than most) when defending NBA legends such as Michael Jordan and Magic Johnson.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis visual and the data provided highlights Larry Bird’s ability to challenge and represent not only one of the greatest shooters in our generation, but of all time. A key takeaway is the difference between the two and three point percentages across some of the best players in the league. Where other players have a wide range between their two and three point percentages, Larry Bird has the closest range. He is a balanced, well rounded player and can display offensive accuracy no matter where he lets off his shot. This two and three point range caused him to be a crucial offensive player and a dangerous threat for opponents.\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nallplayers <- read_csv(\"data/allplayers.csv\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis graph shows how elite of a scorer Larry Bird was when compared to other great scorers. He is right around the top when it comes to NBA scoring, despite some of them having longer careers than he did. He’s up there with guys who are considered legends in the current NBA with names such as Lebron James and Stephen Curry and that is no easy task."
