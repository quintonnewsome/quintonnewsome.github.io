    "text": "Larry bird is the most well-rounded player of all time.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(rvest)\nlibrary(ggalt)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWell rounded players within the NBA typically have above average offensive and defensive skills. Larry Bird’s stats did not present him as a defensive forerunner because he wasn’t excelling in steals and blocks. Despite his defensive stats, Bird is considered to be one of the best defenders to play basketball. This outlook is due to Bird’s impressive stats (better than most) when defending NBA legends such as Michael Jordan and Magic Johnson.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis visual and the data provided highlights Larry Bird’s ability to challenge and represent not only one of the greatest shooters in our generation, but of all time. A key takeaway is the difference between the two and three point percentages across some of the best players in the league. Where other players have a wide range between their two and three point percentages, Larry Bird has the closest range. He is a balanced, well rounded player and can display offensive accuracy no matter where he lets off his shot. This two and three point range caused him to be a crucial offensive player and a dangerous threat for opponents.\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nallplayers <- read_csv(\"data/allplayers.csv\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis graph shows how elite of a scorer Larry Bird was when compared to other great scorers. He is right around the top when it comes to NBA scoring, despite some of them having longer careers than he did. He’s up there with guys who are considered legends in the current NBA with names such as Lebron James and Stephen Curry and that is no easy task."

    "text": "This project is based on the 2021 season for the Nebraska Corn huskers because it was very unlucky and I seen in front-row in in person. I felt what the team was going through, and most people only saw the finished product of the team, I was apart of the building and grinding of the 2021 season. I saw the talent we had and the time we spent working to get better. So I wanted to take a look at how my team’s comparison against the other three-win teams, and to find out if this team is the best three-win team in football.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(cfbfastR)\nlibrary(ggbeeswarm)\n\nfblogs <- cfbd_stats_season_team(2021,season_type = \"regular\")\n\nwl <- read_csv(\"wl_data.csv\") %>% mutate(windiff = total.wins - expectedWins)\n\nsr <- read_csv(\"sports_ref_data.csv\") %>% separate(Conf, into=c(\"Conference\", \"Division\"), sep=\"\\\\(\")\n\nneb <- sr %>% \n  filter(Team == \"Nebraska\")\n\nthreewin <- sr %>% \n  filter(W == 3) %>% \n  filter(Team != \"Nebraska\")\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_beeswarm(data=sr, aes(x=SOS, y=Conference), color=\"light grey\") +\n  geom_beeswarm(data=threewin, aes(x=SOS, y=Conference), color=\"blue\") +\n  geom_beeswarm(data=neb, aes(x=SOS, y=Conference), color=\"#E41C38\") +\n  geom_text_repel(data=neb, aes(x=SOS, y=Conference, label=Team)) +\n  geom_text_repel(data=threewin, aes(x=SOS, y=Conference, label=Team)) +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Strength of Schedule Rating\", \n   y=\"\", \n  title=\"Nebraska Faced Better Opponents Than The Other Three Win Teams\", \n  subtitle=\"The Huskers played the hardest schedule compared to the three-win teams.\", \n  caption=\"Source: sports-reference.com | Chart by Quinton Newsome\"\n  ) + \n   theme_minimal() + \n  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 12, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 10), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=8),\n    plot.caption = element_text(size = 7),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\nI took a look at the strength of schedule, and I filtered the three-win teams. Once I had that I created a beeswarm plot to show that nebraska faced way tougher opponents than the other three-win teams. We are in a league of our own when compared to the three-win teams. Our performance was very strong this season despite our three wins that our schedule doesn’t even compare to theirs. It’s crazy to think about, especially when you factor in that we had one of the toughest schedules to play in all of college football. We lost many games by such few points.\n\n\nCode\nthreewin2 <- sr %>% \n  filter(W == \"3\")\n\nnu <- sr %>% \n  filter(Team == \"Nebraska\")\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_col(data=threewin2, aes(x=Team, y=SRS), fill=\"dark grey\") +\n  geom_col(data=nu, aes(x=Team, y=SRS), fill=\"red\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(\n    x=\"\", \n    y=\"Simple Rating System\", \n    title=\"Huskers Team Defensive and Offensive Rating\", \n    subtitle=\"The Huskers were the only three win team to finish have a postive offensive & defensive rating.\", \n    caption=\"Source: Sports-Reference.com | By Quinton Newsome\") +\n  theme_minimal()+\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 12, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 12), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10),\n    plot.caption = element_text(size = 7),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n   plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\nThis graph does a good job of illustrating just how close we were in every game we lost this season. You can see the difference of ratings in the games like Northwestern. We were in every game we played this season, and we don’t belong in the three-win category at all.\nFinally, I wanted to see how Nebraska and the other three-win teams compared to the rest of the NCAA. I wanted to take a look at each team’s expected win differential, so I created a metric that looked at each team’s total wins from their expected number of wins going into the season.\n\n\nCode\nneb2 <- wl %>% \n  filter(team == \"Nebraska\") \n\nthreewin2 <- wl %>% filter(total.wins == 3)\n  \nggplot() + \n  geom_point(\n    data=wl, \n    aes(x=expectedWins, y=total.wins, size=windiff), \n    color=\"darkgrey\", alpha=.4) +\n  geom_point(\n    data=threewin2, \n    aes(x=expectedWins, y=total.wins, size=windiff), \n    color=\"purple\", alpha=.7)+\n  geom_point(\n    data=neb2, \n    aes(x=expectedWins, y=total.wins, size=windiff),  color=\"#E41C38\") +\n   geom_text_repel(\n    data=neb2, \n    aes(x=expectedWins, y=total.wins, label=team)) + \n  scale_size(range = c(0,5), name=\"Win Differential\") +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Expected Wins\", \n    y=\"Total Wins\", \n    title=\"Nebraska should not be in this 3-win category\", \n    subtitle=\"The other teams literally were expected lose way more games\", \ncaption=\"Purple = Three Win Teams                                         `                         Source: Sports-Reference.com | By Quinton Newsome\") +\n  theme_minimal()+\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 18, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 12), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=8),\n    plot.caption = element_text(size = 7),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see, Nebraska was the only team expected to win more games out of all the three win teams. We played tough teams all season, and we played all those teams tough.\nWith all the statistics and graphs shown in my website, it’s easy to see that Nebraska does not belong in this three win category. The data shows that this team is capable of a lot more aand should expect a lot more going into next season."
